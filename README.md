## About
For our CMU Build18 2024 Project, we are deploying a HTR (handwritten text recognition) model on the NVIDIA Jetson. Although we have advanced systems for recognizing printed text, handwritten text is still considered a challenging problem statement. The high variance in handwriting styles across people and poor quality of the handwritten text compared to printed text pose significant hurdles in converting it to machine readable text. 

HTR can be used in a variety of applications, such as quick scanning of forms and other handwritten texts. This could also be useful for visually impaired users, where we can translate handwritten to digital text and audio.

## Development Roadmap
The following are some useful resources:
* [Handwritten Character Recognition:](https://nanonets.com/blog/handwritten-character-recognition/) Useful guide on training a HTR model with datasets we can use
* [Tesseract:](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract?tab=readme-ov-file) Leading OCR model for printed text
